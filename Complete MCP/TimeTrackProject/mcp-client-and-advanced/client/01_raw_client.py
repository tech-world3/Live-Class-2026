"""
01 -- THE RAW CLIENT
=====================
The most explicit, most verbose way to talk to an MCP server. Nothing
here is hidden -- every step the protocol actually needs is written out
by hand, so you can see exactly what happens.

!! KNOWN BUG, PLEASE READ BEFORE RUNNING !!
There is a real, currently open bug where the line `stdio_client(...)`
below hangs FOREVER on macOS specifically (official SDK issue #1452).
If this script just sits there and never prints anything, that is why --
it is not a mistake in this code. Skip straight to 02, which does the
exact same thing safely.

SETUP:
    pip install mcp

RUN:
    python3 01_raw_client.py
