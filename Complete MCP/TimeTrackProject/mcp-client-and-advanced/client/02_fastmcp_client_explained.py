02 -- THE EASY CLIENT, EXPLAINED STEP BY STEP
================================================
Before jumping into the one-line pattern you'll see everywhere in this
course -- "async with Client(...) as client:" -- let's break down
exactly what a client needs to do, in plain English, one step at a time.

WHAT A CLIENT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO DO (five steps, nothing more):
  1. START the server (or connect to one already running)
  2. SAY HELLO -- the handshake from the Lifecycle video
  3. ASK what tools exist
  4. USE one of them
  5. SAY GOODBYE -- close the connection cleanly, even if something broke

That's the whole job. Everything below is just two different ways of
writing those same five steps.

WHY DOES THE CODE LOOK LIKE "async with Client(...) as client:"?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You could write this the "manual" way, spelling out every step:

    client = Client("../main.py")
    await client.__aenter__()          # steps 1 + 2: start + handshake
    try:
        ... use the client here ...     # steps 3 + 4
    finally:
        await client.__aexit__(None, None, None)   # step 5 -- ALWAYS runs

That works. But it's easy to get wrong -- forget that "finally" block,
and a script that crashes halfway through leaves the server subprocess
running in the background forever, with nobody around to close it.

Python's "async with" does exactly that manual version FOR you,
automatically, and it GUARANTEES step 5 happens no matter what:

    async with Client("../main.py") as client:
        ... use the client here ...
    # step 5 already happened here automatically, even if something above failed

So "async with" isn't a new concept to learn -- it's just "always clean
up properly," written in one line instead of five. Both versions below
do the identical five steps. Run this file and watch them do the same
thing, two different ways.
