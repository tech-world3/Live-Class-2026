03 -- CONNECTING TO A REAL, DEPLOYED SERVER OVER HTTP
========================================================
Every file so far launched main.py as a LOCAL subprocess over stdio.
This file connects to the EXACT SAME TimeTrack server -- except this one
is already running, permanently, on the actual internet. It was deployed
earlier in this course and is live right now at the URL below.

THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGES: you pass a URL instead of a file path.
FastMCP detects the difference automatically and switches from stdio to
Streamable HTTP -- same tools, same behavior, completely different road,
exactly like the Transport Layer video explained.

No local server to start. No subprocess. Just a URL, reachable from
anywhere, by anyone -- not just you.

SETUP:
    pip install fastmcp

RUN:
    python3 03_fastmcp_client_http.py

#                           -> total_hours: 19.0, Asha Patel: 13.5, Rahul Mehta: 5.5
