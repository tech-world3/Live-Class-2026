06 -- ELICITATION: THE SERVER ASKS A REAL QUESTION
=====================================================
main.py's "log_time_with_confirmation" tool calls ctx.elicit(...)
whenever hours look unusually high. That call PAUSES the tool, mid-way
through, and waits for a real answer from the client. This file
provides that answer.

A NOTE WORTH KNOWING: the newest MCP protocol revision (2026-07-28) is
stateless -- it has no back-channel at all for server-initiated requests,
so ctx.elicit() raises an error on a connection negotiated at that
version. Elicitation itself isn't gone (there's a modern "return an
InputRequiredResult and get re-invoked" pattern for it), but the simple
imperative ctx.elicit() this demo relies on only works on the classic,
session-based handshake. So we pin the client to mode="legacy" below to
force that older handshake and keep this demo working as written.

SETUP:
    pip install fastmcp

RUN:
    python3 06_elicitation_demo.py
