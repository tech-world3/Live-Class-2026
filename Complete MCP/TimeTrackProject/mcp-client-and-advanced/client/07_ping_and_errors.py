"""
07 -- PING AND A REAL ERROR
=============================
Two of the "special cases" from the Lifecycle video, now actually
happening instead of being a JSON example on a slide.

A NOTE WORTH KNOWING: `ping` is removed as of the newest MCP protocol
revision (2026-07-28) -- it only works under the classic, session-based
handshake. So, same as the elicitation demo, we pin mode="legacy" here
to keep client.ping() working as written.

RUN:
    python3 07_ping_and_errors.py
