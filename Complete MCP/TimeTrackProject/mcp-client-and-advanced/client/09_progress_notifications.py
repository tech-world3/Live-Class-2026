"""
09 -- PROGRESS NOTIFICATIONS, WATCHED LIVE
=============================================
main.py's "slow_tool" reports its progress as it works. Here we give the
client a progress_handler, so every update prints the moment it arrives
-- instead of the client just sitting there for 5 seconds wondering if
anything is happening.

NOTE: "progress_handler" is also set when you CREATE the Client, not
per-call -- same rule as timeout in the previous file.

RUN:
    python3 09_progress_notifications.py
